# Form-Validator
The Form Validator page is a web page that allows users to input their information and validates the form fields using JavaScript.
The page consists of a form with several input fields, including a username field, an email field, and password fields.
The form has an event listener attached to the submit event. When the user submits the form, the listener prevents the default form submission behavior and performs the validation checks. If all the required fields are filled and pass the validation checks, the form is considered valid.
